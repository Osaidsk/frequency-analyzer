Frequency Analyzer
Detect the dominant frequency in bird voice recordings.

Overview

This project analyzes audio recordings of bird sounds to determine their dominant frequencies. It’s designed for ornithologists, bioacoustics researchers, and hobbyists interested in bird vocalization analysis.

Features

Extracts and visualizes the dominant frequency from audio files
Focuses on bird voice recordings
Written entirely in Python
Simple and easy to use

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required packages (install with pip):
bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

Usage

Place your audio file (e.g., WAV format) in the project directory.

Run the main script:
bash
python "bird voice.py"

Follow the on-screen prompts to analyze your file.

Example Output

Plots of the original waveform and its frequency spectrum
Printed dominant frequency value

Files
